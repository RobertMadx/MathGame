Learning Mathematics

I was required to develop an interactive math learning application for young children. The application presents a question and the player submits an answer. The application marks the submitted answer and counts both the number of attempts and the number of correct answers.
Each question must calculate three numbers using a mixture of addition and multiplication, e.g. 1 + 2 x 3. Each number is limited from 1 to 10, and is also presented as a picture including the number of countable figures.
