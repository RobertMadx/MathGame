Learning Mathematics

The application presents a question and the player submits an answer. Then marks the submitted answer and counts both the number of attempts and the number of correct answers.
Each question must calculate three numbers using a mixture of addition and multiplication, e.g. 1 + 2 x 3. Each number is limited from 1 to 10, and is also presented as a picture including the number of countable figures.
